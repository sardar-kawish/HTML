HTML,
 which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web.

 It is the foundation of web pages and is used to define the structure and presentation of web content. 
HTML
 documents are composed of elements that are marked up with tags, which describe the content's meaning and how it should be displayed in web browsers.

HTML Tags:
 HTML documents consist of various tags that are enclosed in angle brackets ("<" and ">").
 Tags are used to define elements and their properties.

For example, 
the <p> tag is used to create paragraphs, and the <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks.

Elements:
 HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages.
 They are composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
 For example:
html
code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Attributes:
 HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. 
Attributes are included in the opening tag.
 For example, 
the <a> tag can have an href attribute to specify the URL of the link:
html
 code
<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/">Visit google.co</a>

Head and Body:
 An HTML document typically consists of two main sections: 
the <head> section and the <body> section. 
The <head> section contains metadata about the document, such as the page title and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts.
 The <body> section contains the visible content of the web page.

Text Formatting: 
HTML provides tags for formatting text, such as headings (<h1> to <h6>), emphasis (<em> and <strong>), line breaks (<br>), and more.

Lists: 
HTML allows you to create ordered lists (<ol>), unordered lists (<ul>), and definition lists (<dl>) to organize content.

Links and Anchors:
 Hyperlinks are created using the <a> (anchor) tag. 
They allow users to navigate to other web pages or resources.

Images: 
Images can be displayed using the <img> tag,
 with the src attribute specifying the image file's URL.

Forms:
 HTML forms are created using the <form> tag and allow users to input data.
 Form elements include text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and more.

Tables:
 Tables can be created with the <table>, <tr> (table row), <th> (table header), and 
<td> (table data) elements for organizing data in a tabular format.

Comments:
 HTML comments are used to add notes or explanations within the code.
 They are enclosed in <!-- and -->
<!--  
 tags and are not visible in the rendered web page.
Semantic HTML:
 HTML5 introduced semantic elements like 
<header>,
 <nav>,
 <article>,
 <section>, 
<footer>, and more. 
These elements provide meaning to the structure of the document and help improve accessibility and SEO. -->
